# Federated Learning image classifier as final project for Secure and Private AI Course

Aim:
Our aim is to create an Android app that users can use to take photos of marks or spots on their skin in order to identify whether the mark was a sign of skin cancer and the person should go and seek more specialist diagnosis. All photos of a person’s skin would be protected by federated learning privacy techniques.

Project Steps:
To verify the compatibility of using pre-trained models with PySyft Federated Learning. Our notebook reflects our attempts at creating an image classifier model with a starting point of using a pre-trained model like resnet50 to speed up the accuracy of the model from the start.

To test our approach we have been using the Dog v Cat dataset which is readily available for download from microsoft here.

We have been found difficulties in using a pre-trained model with PySyft. So, we have created our own CNN architecture from scratch to demonstrate that we are able to implement federated learning with an Image CNN classifier.

We will continue to go forward with the project.

Future steps:
1. Obtain a dataset with skin cancer images for use in training the model.
2. Develop code to use transfer learning in order to have a robust model to start the model training on skin images.
3. Develop python scripts of model.
4. Develop an android app to deploy python scripts of the model.
